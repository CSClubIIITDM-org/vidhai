# Structure of Vidhai


In-order to produce an efficient work culture, the volunteers of Vidhai were split into 6 teams.

1. Teaching Team: It includes volunteers who are passionate towards teaching, visit the school on Saturdays to teach the students using activity based teaching methods.
2. Curriculum team: It includes volunteers who research on the content to teach and design activities for the teaching sessions.
3. Scheduling/Feedback team: These volunteers collect data of new volunteers and allot them to their respective teams. Also they conduct feedback sessions after every teaching session. The scheduling team coordinator acts as the **HR manager** of Vidhai.
4. Logistics/Inventory team: It includes volunteers who maintain logistics of Vidhai and who procure logistics necessary for the sessions.
5. Finance team: The responsibilities of the Finance team are to maintain clear and transparent accounting of vidhai, collecting donations and allocating revenue optimally.
6. Publicity team: Volunteers of this team publicise Vidhai and maintain various social media platforms and create content for publicity.

**Manager of the Week:** Every week a selected volunteer is responsible for coordinating all the activities necessary for successful completion of that week’s teaching session. It’s the special part of Vidhai where every volunteer gets an opportunity to exhibit his/her management skills.
Each team (except curriculum team), has **team coordinators** who lead and collaborate to serve the responsibilities of their team.
In curriculum team, there are **15 program coordinators**, who are responsible for each program under EQUIPPED curriculum.
