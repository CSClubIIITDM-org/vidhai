# Our Programmes
## EQUIPPED
EQUIPPED is a unique curriculum developed by the volunteers of Vidhai. The idea behind this curriculum was to ‘equip’ children with
specific knowledge about certain topics that will be very much useful for them when they become adults. The objective of this curriculum is to produce well informed and responsible citizens for our country. There are 15 programs (topics) that we will be teaching the students.

- Banking
- Personal finance
- Survival skills
- Self learning and Critical thinking
- Public speaking/Communication skills
- English
- Health and mental wellness
- Environmental awareness
- Constitution
- Arts
- Computer science
- Technology
- Humanities and Ethics
- Career guidance
- E-Services

All these topics were split among our curriculum volunteers and each of them did a thorough research in each topic to develop the content along with necessary activities, from March 2020. We have planned to start teaching ‘EQUIPPED’ syllabus from the 2020-21 academic year in the Kumizhi Government School.

## Vidhai Exams Possible
Vidhai developed a program to prepare students in government school to write and achieve in national level scholarship exams. The
main motto of the program is to make the **underprivileged talented students** get into the national level scholarship exams and is being offered to grades 7 to 10. The program started in March 2020, where volunteers started preparing content for NMMS (National Means Cum Merit Scholarship) Exam for class 8 and NTSE (National Talent Search Exam) for class 10.

For classes 7th and 9th, we teach them from basics. For 8th and 10th class we teach them tricks/shortcuts and give a lot of mock exams. We also offer a set of videos and online tests for these students so that they get a better understanding of the subject and learn however many times they want to.
