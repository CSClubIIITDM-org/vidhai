They visited government schools in villages surrounding our campus such as kandigai, keerapakkam, kumizhi and melakottaiyur. They conducted both teaching and non-teaching activities in the schools. They conducted 27 hours of session during that period.
Vidhai(2019-2020) Vidhai was re-initiated in October 2019 with more active volunteers and an organized structure of work.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://webopsiiitdmk.github.io/vidhai/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://webopsiiitdmk.github.io/vidhai/intro/</guid><description>What is Vidhai?

The idea behind this curriculum was to ‘equip’ children with specific knowledge about certain topics that will be very much useful for them when they become adults. The objective of this curriculum is to produce well informed and responsible citizens for our country. There are 15 programs (topics) that we will be teaching the students.
Banking Personal finance Survival skills Self learning and Critical thinking Public speaking/Communication skills English Health and mental wellness Environmental awareness Constitution Arts Computer science Technology Humanities and Ethics Career guidance E-Services All these topics were split among our curriculum volunteers and each of them did a thorough research in each topic to develop the content along with necessary activities, from March 2020.</description></item><item><title>Structure</title><link>https://webopsiiitdmk.github.io/vidhai/structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://webopsiiitdmk.github.io/vidhai/structure/</guid><description>Structure of Vidhai In-order to produce an efficient work culture, the volunteers of Vidhai were split into 6 teams.
